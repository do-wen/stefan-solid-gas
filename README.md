# Stefan problem for solids and rarefied gases

This is a proof-of-concept of the numerical method described in the Master Thesis *Generalized Stefan Problem for Solids and Rarefied Gases*.
The code is written in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), tested for v1.7.2.

The presented files reproduce the plots from the thesis. Some might need adjustment in the code to produce all desired plots, see the corresponding comments.
